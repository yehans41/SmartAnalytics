A production-ready ML platform demonstrating end-to-end data engineering and machine learning workflows for NYC taxi trip analysis.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Smart Analytics is a comprehensive ML platform that showcases:

- **Data Engineering**: Automated ETL pipelines with quality checks and data versioning
- **ML Breadth**: 13 models across 4 families (regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- **MLOps**: Experiment tracking, model registry, automated deployment, and monitoring
- **Modern AI**: LLM-generated model cards and automated insights
- **Software Engineering**: Clean architecture, testing, documentation, and CI/CD

### What Makes This Different?

Unlike typical toy projects, this platform demonstrates:
- ✅ Real-world dataset (3M+ NYC taxi trips)
- ✅ Production-ready code with proper error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (100+ tests)
- ✅ Docker-based deployment
- ✅ Interactive web dashboard
- ✅ REST API for model serving
- ✅ Complete documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**
- **Python 3.9+**
- **8GB+ RAM recommended**

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartAnalytics.git
cd SmartAnalytics

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Start Services

```bash
# Start all services (MySQL, MLflow, API, Dashboard)
make docker-up

# Or use the quickstart script for complete setup
./scripts/quickstart.sh
```

### 3. Run the Pipeline

```bash
# Option A: Run complete pipeline
make pipeline

# Option B: Run step-by-step
make ingest          # Download and load data
make process         # Clean and validate
make features        # Engineer features
make train           # Train all models
```

### 4. Access the Platform
